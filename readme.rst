I cretated tatva database for this project also i uploaded sql file here.
to open the main page
[click here] (http://localhost/tatva/)

*******************
Controller
*******************

I created Event controller where i added function for index, create, edit, delete, view and date convert related function.

**************************
Model
**************************

I created Event_model file inside model folder where i did all the database related operation.

*******************
View
*******************

I created add page and list page on the same page so index.php is for add and event list, i used jquery validation and ajax for submitting the data.
View and Edit page is separate but we can show the data in textboxes when we click on edit in index page but for now i created separate page for it.

As per the requirement i displayed Recurrence wise data in view page. Please check and give me feedback i any mistake found.


Thanks.
